# Using Daytona for Django Project Management

## Introduction

After successfully submitting my project for Challenge #1, where I built a project management app using Daytona and Django, I’m excited to share my experience and guide others through the process. This article will walk you through how I integrated Daytona into my project and why it proved invaluable. If you’re a developer looking to streamline your development workflow, this tutorial is for you.

## Taking the Sample Project

Utilized Daytona for setting up the development environment.
Integrated the Google Maps API for location-based features.
Styled the application with TailwindCSS.
Here’s how I used Daytona in the project and why it was beneficial.

## Why Daytona Was a Game-Changer
Daytona drastically simplified the setup process for my Django project. Instead of manually configuring my environment, Daytona provided a ready-to-use boilerplate that:

- Pre-configured the project with Django and TailwindCSS.
- Managed environment variables securely with .env files.
- Reduced the initial setup time from hours to minutes.


## Key Benefits of Using Daytona:
- **Time-Saving Setup**: Daytona eliminated the need for manual setup, allowing me to start coding almost immediately.
- **Pre-configured Environment**: It came with essential configurations for Django,TailwindCSS, and other dependencies.
- **Environment Management**: The .env.example template made managing environment variables simple and secure.


## Project Overview
 We’ll build a project management app with:
- Daytona for environment setup.
- TailwindCSS for responsive design.


## Tutorial: Building a Project with Daytona
In this tutorial, I’ll explain how you can use Daytona to build a similar project. This tutorial assumes a basic understanding of Django and web development.

1. **Creating the Project**
- Use Daytona to create your project repository:
    ```sh
        daytona create <your_repo_url>
    ```
- Navigate to the project folder:
    ```sh
        cd Project-Management
    ```
2. **Setting Up Environment Variables**

- Copy the .env.example file to .env:
    ```sh
        cp .env.example .env
    ```

3. **Installing Dependencies**
- Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
        pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Running the Application**
- Apply migrations and start the server:
    ```sh
        python manage.py migrate
        python manage.py runserver
    ```
6. **Viewing the Application**
- Visit http://localhost:8000 to see the app in action.


## Conclusion
Daytona revolutionized the way I approach Django development by providing a quick, efficient setup process. Through this tutorial, I hope to inspire other developers to explore Daytona and experience the same benefits I did.
